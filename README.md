# Monitoring

This sample application shows how to build a simple REST API using Spring Boot, MVC and Data JPA. It exposes methods to manage accounts and monitor their activities. Monitoring uses in-memory HSQLDB and does not persist data across launches. This is a deliberate choice for the sample application.

## Run

Use the following command to run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
